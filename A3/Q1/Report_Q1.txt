Q1:

Let us assume an input vector of size 'n'
1.   How many floating operations are being performed in your color conversion kernel?
Ans. Number of operations is one per r,g,b of the input vector. So equals 'n'

2.   Which format would be more efficient for color conversion: a 2D matrix where each entry is an RGB value or a
     3D matrix where each slice in the Z axis representes a color. I.e. is it better to have color interleaved in this
     application? can you name an application where the opposite is true?
Ans. The latter is better.

3.   How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel?
Ans. Number of global memory reads are equal to the size of the input vector = 'n';

4.   How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel?
Ans. Number of global memory writes are equal to the size of the input vector/3 = 'n/3';

5.   Describe what possible optimizations can be implemented to your kernel to achieve a performance speedup.
Ans. Tiling can be one of the possible optimizations.
