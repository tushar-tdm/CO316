Q2. Perform Matrix Multiplication of two large integer matrices in CUDA. Answer the following questions.

Let us consider matrices of size aXb and bXc 

1.   How many integer operations are being performed in your matrix multiply kernel?
Ans. For above matrices, there are 2*a*b*c operations performed(half each for add and multiply). 

2.   How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel?
Ans. The global memory read occurs for every multiplication operation, so a*b*c reads.

3.   How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel?
Ans. The global memory writes occur when the addition operation occurs, so a*b*c writes.

4.   Describe what possible optimizations can be implemented to your kernel to achieve a performance speedup.
Ans. Possible optimizations include using shared memory to bring the data that will be operated on by the threads all a once so that read operations can be reduced.
